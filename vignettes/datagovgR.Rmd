R wrapper package for the [data.gov.gr](https://www.data.gov.gr/) API.

The goal of datagovgR is to enable R users, data analysts, academics and students to work with the Greek open governmental data programmatically. By default, the package returns queries from the v1 API on <https://data.gov.gr/api/v1/>. *Unfortunately, no official documentation has come to my attention for this API.*

The following endpoints are currently available through the package:

-   **"mdg_emvolio"** Covid-19 Vaccination Statistics

You will need an access token to retrieve records from data.gov.gr. You may request for your API token on <https://www.data.gov.gr/token>. After your request, check your email regularly for your data.gov.gr API token.
